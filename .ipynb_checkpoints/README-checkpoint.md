Module 4 Challenge

Two things stood out in this data. The first being that the Charter schools excelled in both the scores and percentage passing for both reading and math. The second is that the Districts had much larger budgets and per capita spending and their scores and percentages were lower. I looked at 2 district schools in particular - Hernandez and Johnson. Both of these schools had budgets that were over $3 million and per capitas over $650 per student and had a llow percentage of passing rates for both math and reading. At first glance, I looked at the number of students passing and thought that the schools had done well. I then noticed that both schools and more students. After you look at the number of students vs. passing percentages, you notice that the schools are not doing well as it looked based on students passing. Based on the data, the Districts need a bigger budget or they need to find a better use of the find to increase the math and reading percentages.
